# PaintDowngrade
It is a limited graphics editor with the ability to draw shapes, manipulate shapes and manage groups of shapes.

This editor is a laboratory assignment for my programming class at the university. Made on the basis of the game engine, which in turn is a copy of Hazel with some changes.
